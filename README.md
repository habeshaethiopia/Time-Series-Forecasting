## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Week11-Time-Series-Forecasting
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
5. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Guidelines
- Use the `data` module to load and preprocess your datasets.
- Implement and train models within the `models` module.
- Utilize the `notebooks` directory for exploratory data analysis and visualization.
- Run scripts from the `scripts` module for data processing and model evaluation.
- Write and execute tests in the `tests` module to ensure code quality.
